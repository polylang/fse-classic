# Site Editor Classic Features

Welcome to the Site Editor Classic Features repository on GitHub. Here you can browse the source, discuss/open issues and keep track of the development.

If you are not a developer, we recommend to [download Site Editor Classic Features](https://wordpress.org/plugins/fse-classic/) from WordPress directory.

## [What this plugin is for](#fse-classic)

Currently this plugin adds the legacy widgets block in any kind of block editor, more specifically the Site Editor (FSE) introduced in WordPress 5.9.

By reintroducing the legacy widgets block, you can use some of the legacy widgets as `Navigation Menu` for example.

However with blocks theme, like Twenty Twenty-Two, you can't update menus anymore because this kind of theme doesn't support menus.

This is why this plugin reintroduces the WordPress admin menus to be able to manage menus you want to use with the legacy widgets block.

This also allows to use external plugins legacy widgets which might not have already been converted to blocks.

## [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)

Before starting, make sure that you have the following software installed and working on your computer:

1. A local [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) (5.9 or later) instance
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to clone the FSE Classic repository (or your fork of the FSE Classic repository).
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which provides [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/). They are both required by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) that FSE Classic uses to build and minify CSS and javascript files. We recommend to install Node.js LTS version.
4. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) because FSE Classic uses its autoloader to work and it is required to install development tools such as PHP CodeSniffer that ensures your code follows coding standards.

## [How to set up Site Editor Classic Features](#how-to-setup-fse-classic)

The simplest way is to clone locally this repository and build it directly in your local WordPress instance by following the steps below:

1. Go to your local WordPress instance wp-content/plugins/ folder:<br/>
`cd your/local/wordpress/path/wp-content/plugins`
2. Clone there the FSE Classic repository (or your fork) from GitHub:<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/polylang/fse-classic.git`
3. Go to your local fse-classic clone folder from there: `cd fse-classic`
4. Run the composer command: `composer build`
5. Activate FSE Classic as if you had installed it from WordPress.org:<br/>

**Note**: we recommend Windows users to use `Git Bash` provided with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) instead of the command or powershell terminals.
